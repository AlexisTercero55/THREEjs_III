For running parcel, make sure that your have script running rigths.
In case you don't have permissions, try this on powershell as administrator:

    Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

Working with SHADOWS requier the following steps:

    - Enable shadows from the light source:

        light.castShadow = true;

    - from Meshes: cast or receive:

        obj.castShadow = true;
        obj.receiveShadow = true;


Long animation design:

Agregations help us to achieve the animation loop
as well as oop claims, this effort provides the
'.nextFrame()' method to each object that have a behavior
during the animation loop, that means, '.nextFrame()' method
is for objs that needs to be update during the animation.

Updates are triggered by different events, we'll focus
when each frame are rendered. This event is listening by

    Loop.start() method

Internally .start() method manage animation loop and
changes the objects state around the animation loop.
Actually object state not always need to be updated,
as I said, there are other events that raise updates.
Other processes like computation of physics, 
perspective changes, focus changes and any other interactions
can comunicate objects this changes by mapping flags values.

{
    'obj_i' : 'flag'
}
