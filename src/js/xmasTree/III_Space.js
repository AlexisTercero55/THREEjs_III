    /** Working With the Camera While Using OrbitControls
     * With the controls in place, 
     * we have relinquished control of the camera to them. 
     * However, sometimes you need to take back control to 
     * manually position the camera. There are two ways 
     * to go about this:
     * 
     * - Cut/jump to a new camera position
     * - Smoothly animate to a new camera position. 
     * */
    /** Cut to a New Camera Position
     * 
     * To perform a camera cut, update the camera’s 
     * transform as usual, and then call 'controls.update'
     * If you’re calling .update in the loop, you don’t need 
     * to do it manually and you can simply move the camera. 
     * If you move the camera without calling .update, 
     * weird things will happen, so watch out!
     * 
     * One important thing to note here: 
     * when you move the camera, the controls.target does 
     * not move. If you have not moved it, it will remain 
     * at the center of the scene. When you move the camera 
     * to a new position but leave the target unchanged, 
     * the camera will not only move but also rotate so that 
     * it continues to point at the target. This means that 
     * camera movements may not work as you expect when using 
     * the controls. Often, you will need to move the camera 
     * and the target at the same time to get your desired 
     * outcome.
     * 
     * this method is useful for long animations and real time
     * animations even with gui implementations.

    /** # Smoothly Transition to a New Camera Position
     * 
     * If you want to smoothly animate the camera to a 
     * new position, you will probably need to transition 
     * the camera and the target at the same time, and the 
     * best place to do this is in the controls.nextFrame 
     * method. However, you will need to disable the controls 
     * for the duration of the animation, otherwise, if the 
     * user attempts to move the camera before the animation 
     * has completed, you’ll end up with the controls fighting 
     * against your animation, often with disastrous results.
     * 
     * ## Save and Restore a View State
     * You can save the current view using .saveState()
     * and later restore it using .reset() 
     * 
     * If we call .reset() without first calling .saveState(), 
     * the camera will jump back to the position it was in when 
     * we created the controls.
